This repository demonstrates an **end-to-end data engineering pipeline** on Microsoft Azure. The project covers data ingestion, storage, transformation, analytics, and visualization using the following services:

- **Azure Data Factory** for orchestrating data ingestion  
- **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** for both raw and transformed data  
- **Azure Databricks** for data transformation  
- **Azure Synapse Analytics** for advanced analytics  
- **Power BI** for data visualization

---

## Project Purpose

I created this project to **learn about Azure’s data engineering offerings** and gain hands-on experience integrating multiple Azure services. **Please note that this is an educational project**—the architecture and implementation choices here are not necessarily production-ready or fully optimized for performance, cost, or security.

## Highlights

1. **Data Ingestion**  
   - Using *Data Factory* to ingest raw data from a source system into a **Data Lake Gen2** container.

2. **Data Transformation**  
   - Leveraging *Azure Databricks* to clean, aggregate, and transform raw data, then storing outputs in a “transformed” Data Lake container.

3. **Analytics**  
   - Connecting transformed data to *Azure Synapse Analytics* for further querying and exploration.

4. **Visualization**  
   - Presenting insights in *Power BI* dashboard (WIP).

## Key Takeaways

- Gained a solid **understanding of Azure data services** and how they fit together in a typical data engineering workflow.  
- Explored **ETL/ELT best practices**, although many of the steps here are simplified to illustrate concepts more clearly.  
- Learned about **pipeline orchestration** in Data Factory, **distributed data processing** in Azure Databricks, and **cloud data warehousing** in Synapse.

- This project is intended for **learning and demonstration**.  
- It **is not optimized** for production scenarios and may not follow all security, performance, or compliance best practices.
